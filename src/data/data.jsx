    aboutCoi: `<h4>What is 'Colours of India'?</h4>
    <p>COI is a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO), set up by a group  of Indian NFT artists, for the benefit of Indian NFT artists, collectors and all members of the DAO.</p>
    <h4>Our Mission:</h4>
    <h5>We have a two-fold mission:</h5>
    <ol>
    <li>To serve as a platform for Indian art through empowering Indian artists  to enter the NFT space and by giving them a voice in the global art  community.</li>
    <li>To spread awareness about the decentralised creator economy and the  NFT space in India.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>How are we going about this?</h4>
    <p>Our genesis community project is a collection of 1000 artworks by 1000  different artists that will be released as NFTs and minted on an  international marketplace. Through the course of this first project (and  beyond) the COI team will be educating artists about the NFT space,  promoting the initiative and individual artists (members of the DAO) on  international forums, including global rooms on Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces  and even through our own Colours of India podcast and youtube channel.  We will be running a campaign to get the initiative and its members  visibility in the mainstream media in India as well. All 1000 artworks will be  exhibited in a metaverse gallery for the global community to view.</p>
    <h4>How can I join the DAO? </h4>
    <p>For artists: There is an open call for all Indian artists (either citizens of  India or of Indian ethnicity) to submit a work of art they have created, as  part of their membership application. If selected by our panel of curators,  this artwork will be a part of COIs first project featuring 1000 Indian  artists. Each of these 1000 artists will receive a COI token, which is their  membership to the DAO. These tokens can be sold on the secondary  market, but to do so would mean you are relinquishing your membership 
    of the DAO to the new owner of the token. Every token equals one vote in  the DAO.</p>
    <p>For collectors: Upon collection of any of the 1000 pieces of art, the  collector will receive a COI token that will entitle them to membership.</p>
    <h4>What happens to the art I have submitted?</h4>
    <p>The artwork each artist submits will be attached to a COI token, which will  be anonymously sold to collectors. ie the collector will initially just receive  a COI token without knowing which artwork is attached to it. After all 1000  tokens are sold, the artwork attached to each token will be revealed in the  collector's wallet.</p>
    <p>Once all 1000 tokens are sold, the 1000 artists who have created the  works will receive an equal share of 90% of the gross revenue generated  by the sale. 10% will go into the wallet of the COI DAO.</p>
    <p>Revenue from secondary sales will go to the DAO for all its future projects  (as voted on by the members), some of which will include creating a COI  metaverse, an art fund to invest in interesting projects in the crypto space,  physical exhibitions and events for DAO members and a lot more.</p>
